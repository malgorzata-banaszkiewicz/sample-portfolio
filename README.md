# sample-portfolio

This is a project recreated using figma template. It shows sample portfolio for a designer. Lots of effects, tabs, js counters, form validated with JavaScript, mobile resizeable menu and two sliders: one custom using only JavaScript and one created with the help of slick slider library. 
It was also my first attempt to use JQuery.
